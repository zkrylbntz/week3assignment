week 3 assignment - Cookie Clicker

Requirements

🎯 Fetch upgrade data from the provided API and at least one upgrade from the API update the cookie count.

🎯 Ensure that functions are used effectively to keep code organised and reusable.
🎯 Implement event listeners to handle user interactions.

🎯 Use local storage to save and restore the cookie count and relevant game information.

🎯 Use setInterval to increment the cookie count and manage the game state each second.
Managing the game state includes saving progress and updating the DOM.

Reflection

Please also provide an assignment reflection in your project README.md file.

What went really well and what could have gone better?

This week was a bit different to other weeks so far, I felt a little stuck at the end of Friday, I had made a good bit of progress in the morning but not much had changed during the rest of the day. So I was expecting to submit something that didn't look like a lot.
But I have been able to create something I'm fairly happy with, considering the state I was in on Friday.

However I'm not sure to what extent I have acheive in relation to the requirements.

I was able to get the information from the API, that I was then able to group into columns and then arrange in rows, adding serparate 'buy' buttons for each.

I started off with a basic button, which I was then able to add a picture of a Cookie too, a first for me!
From here I was then able to style what I had and then work on the button functions.

I started with getting the button to add a Cookie each time it was clicked, and changing the Cookies per second to 1 per second.
Then I set an interval to add a Cookie to the Cookie count at every second.

I was very pleased with what I had done and how far I had come since Friday afternoon. And what I had done I had done fairly confidently and to a level of understanding.

I struggled from this point to do anymore, I tried for a long time to get the two values to add together and to display this value.

It appears I have been able to do both, but running at the same time... the Cookies per second starts but as soon as you click it almost resets, and then once finished clicking it catches up with the Cookies per second. And if you click it really fast it goes really really fast.

Side rubber ducking note... is there anyway that as it's set to the click I'm speeding up the interval???

So with not being able to get these two values to work the way I wanted to, I thought it would be quite a lot to get a buying button to work at this point. I wrote out steps of the process but I didn't want to turn it into a huge mess.

I unfortunatley had a little problem(?) with my media queries. I have added them in but commented out. Although when on the inspect element there wasn't a lot that I could change when changing the screen size I thought I would make the button image smaller when it was scaled down. I made it smaller in small increments. But when I came to inspect my changes it didn't appear to do what I wanted... in some cases it seemed as though the images was getting bigger at those points(?) Not only that but when I was viewing my site in the Inspect Dev tool, the scale seemed completely off to how it shows on the browser... I didn't really know what to do in this case as I couldn't see what it was doing, it had gone so small in the viewpoint.

I didn't really look at the goals this week whilst completing the assignment, I took it step by step. Knowing what it should look like and doing what I was capable of doing in order to get it looking and working like the example.

Apologise's for the media queries, I really don't know why they weren't doing what I had intended...

And as far as additional feedback, perhaps if you know why my media queries weren't working... perhaps they would on yours?

But just general futher information on getting my values to add together and maybe how the item buying would come into that, that would be great and interesting!

Thanks Joe!
